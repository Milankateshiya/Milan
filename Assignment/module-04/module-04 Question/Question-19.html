    <h2>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types. <br>

        Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.</p>
        <p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:</p>
    <p>width and height of the viewport <br>
        orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait) <br>
        resolution</p>
        <p>The names chosen for CSS media types reflect target devices for which the relevant properties make sense.</p>
        <p>They give a sense of what device the media type is meant to refer to. </p>
        <p>Given below is a list of various media types :-</p>
