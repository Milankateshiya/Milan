    <h2>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
    </h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. <br>
         It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>
         <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
         <p>There are several different types of selectors:</p>
         <p>class selectors <br>
            ID selectors <br>
            child selectors  <br>
            universal selectors <br>
            adjacent sibling selectors <br>
            attribute selectors <br>
            pseudo-class selectors <br>
            pseudo-element selectors</p>
    <p>Add CSS selectors to a webpage &lt;head&gt; section. <br>
        Store CSS styles and selectors in a separate document and link to it from the &lt;head&gt; section of a webpage</p>
    <p>CSS selectors allow developers to target and style webpage HTML elements. <br>
         You use them to add color, shape, and style to your site. </p>
         <p>designers find it easier to reference CSS selectors from a separate document. </p>
         <p>That allows for a cleaner separation of the HTML code and the CSS language. </p>
