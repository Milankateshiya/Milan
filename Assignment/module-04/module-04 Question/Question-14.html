    <h2>What is embedded style sheets?
    </h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>embedded style sheet is declared within the &lt;head&gt; element of an XHTML document. </p> <br>
    <p>applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. </p> <br>
    <p>Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project.</p> <br>
    <p> Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you to address one HTML element at a time. </p> <br>
