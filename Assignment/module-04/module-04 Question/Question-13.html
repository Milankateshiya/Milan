    <h2>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. <br>
     To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. <br>
      adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet.  <br>
      We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</p> <br>
