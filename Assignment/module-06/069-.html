    <h3>What is negative Infinity?</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <p>
      The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to
      represent a value that is the lowest available.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic
      operation.
    </p>

    <p>This means that no other number is lesser than this value.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any
        other number.
      </li>
      <li>multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.</li>
      <li>The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.</li>
      <li>
        The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
      </li>
    </ul>
